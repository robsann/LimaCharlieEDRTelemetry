## LimaCharlie (EDR) Telemetry
- Windows 11 (Target) with Virus & Threat Prodection disabled, Sysmon and LimaCharlie (EDR) Sensor installed.
- Ubuntu Server (Attack) with Sliver, a Command & Control (C2) framework by BishopFox, installed.
- Generate C2 payload using Sliver, execute payload from Target machine, and start C2 session on Sliver.
- Use C2 session to perform two attacks on Target Machine:
    - LSASS access (credentials stealing)
    - Shadow Copies deletion using vssadmin.exe (used in Ransomware attacks).
- Create Detection & Response rules in LimaCharlie (EDR) to detect the two previous attacks using
the telemetry generated by them and test the rules by performing the attacks again.
